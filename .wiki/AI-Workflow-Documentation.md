# AI Workflow Documentation

This document provides an overview of the AI-assisted development workflows for this plugin.

## Introduction to AI-Assisted Development

AI-assisted development uses artificial intelligence tools to help with coding, documentation, testing, and other development tasks. This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants to make development faster and more efficient.

## Setting Up Your AI Environment

### Required Files

To get the most out of AI-assisted development, make sure to include these files in your AI IDE context:

1. **AGENTS.md**: Contains essential information about the project structure and conventions
2. **.agents/**: Directory containing detailed workflow documentation for common tasks

### Pinning Files in AI IDEs

For the best results, pin these files in your AI IDE chat context:

- **Claude**: Use the "Pin" feature to keep files in context
- **GitHub Copilot**: Use the "Pin" feature in the chat interface
- **ChatGPT**: Use the "Pin" feature in the Advanced Data Analysis mode
- **Other AI IDEs**: Refer to your specific IDE's documentation for pinning files

## AI Workflow Files

The `.agents/` directory contains detailed guides for common development tasks:

1. **plugin-customization.md**: Guide for customizing the plugin for specific needs
2. **feature-development.md**: Workflow for developing new features
3. **bug-fixing.md**: Process for identifying and fixing bugs
4. **testing.md**: Guide for writing and running tests
5. **documentation.md**: Workflow for updating documentation
6. **release-process.md**: Steps for creating new releases
7. **wiki-documentation.md**: Guide for maintaining wiki documentation

## Using the Starter Prompt

The [Starter Prompt](Starter-Prompt) is a comprehensive guide for AI tools to help customize the template for your specific plugin. It includes:

1. **Project Overview**: Description of the plugin and its purpose
2. **Customization Steps**: Detailed steps for customizing the template
3. **File Structure**: Overview of the plugin's file structure
4. **Coding Standards**: Guidelines for code style and quality
5. **Testing Requirements**: Instructions for testing the plugin

## AI-Assisted Development Workflows

### Customizing the Plugin

1. Open your AI IDE and pin the `AGENTS.md` file and `.agents/` directory
2. Provide the Starter Prompt to the AI
3. Follow the AI's guidance to customize the plugin
4. Review and test the changes

### Developing New Features

1. Define the feature requirements
2. Ask the AI to help design the feature
3. Implement the feature with AI assistance
4. Write tests for the feature
5. Update documentation

### Fixing Bugs

1. Describe the bug to the AI
2. Ask the AI to help identify the cause
3. Implement the fix with AI assistance
4. Write tests to prevent regression
5. Update documentation if necessary

### Writing Tests

1. Describe the functionality to be tested
2. Ask the AI to help write unit tests
3. Ask the AI to help write end-to-end tests
4. Run the tests and fix any issues

### Updating Documentation

1. Describe the changes that need documentation
2. Ask the AI to help update the relevant documentation files
3. Review and refine the documentation

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions to the AI
2. **Review Carefully**: Always review AI-generated code before committing
3. **Iterative Approach**: Work with the AI in small, iterative steps
4. **Provide Context**: Keep relevant files in the AI's context
5. **Ask Questions**: If you're unsure about something, ask the AI to explain
6. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test AI-generated code

## Troubleshooting AI Assistance

If you encounter issues with AI assistance:

1. **Refresh Context**: Sometimes the AI may lose context. Try refreshing the conversation or repinning files
2. **Be More Specific**: Provide more detailed instructions
3. **Break Down Tasks**: Divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts
4. **Provide Examples**: Show examples of what you want
5. **Try Different Approaches**: If one approach doesn't work, try a different one

## Conclusion

AI-assisted development can significantly speed up your workflow and improve code quality. By following these guidelines and using the provided AI workflow documentation, you can make the most of AI tools in your development process.
